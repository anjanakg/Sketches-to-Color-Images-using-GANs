# Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate sculptures based on their outlines. 

For this task I used the same image dataset which was used for the sculpture classification task. First, I created the outline image for each image in the dataset using a python script. Then I used those images for model training.

### I tried with some images from the web for testing. The results were not too bad. The model was smart enough to add green to trees. The actual images were taken during the fall/winter seasons.

### It added colors on me. Well, not bad....
